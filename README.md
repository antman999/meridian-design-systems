Welcome to Meridian Design Systems, an open-source library aimed at streamlining the creative process for designers and developers. As a work in progress, Meridian is on a mission to simplify the way developers create for personal and business projects.

### Key Features

**Regression Testing:** Each Pull request compares the previous design against the PR to ensure no UI regressions get shipped.
